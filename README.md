# ImageJ_macros
## For batch processing of z-stack microscopy images

* [batch_splitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_splitter.ijm): Splits multi-channel z-stacks into single-channel z-stacks
* [batch_rescaler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_rescaler.ijm): Rescales single-channel z-stacks
* [batch_MIP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_MIP.ijm): Performs maximum intensity projection on single channel z-stacks
* [LIFs2TIFs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/LIFs2TIFs.ijm): takes all LIF files in a folder and exports all series of each LIF as TIFs
* [batch_32bitRGB_to_8bitX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_32bitRGB_to_8bitX.ijm): Batch converts the single channel TIFs that NDP.view2 generates into grayscale images to reduce filesize by 75%
