# ImageJ_macros
## Basic ImageJ macros for batch processing of z-stack microscopy images

* batch_splitter: Splits multi-channel z-stacks into single-channel z-stacks
* batch_rescaler: Rescales single-channel z-stacks
* batch_MIP: Performs maximum intensity projection on single channel z-stacks
* LIFs2TIFs: takes all LIF files in a folder and exports all series of each LIF as TIFs
