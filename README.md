# ImageJ_macros
## For batch processing of microscopy images

* [batch_channel_splitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_splitter.ijm): Splits multi-channel z-stacks into single-channel z-stacks
* [batch_rescaler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_rescaler.ijm): Rescales single-channel z-stacks
* [batch_MIP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_MIP.ijm): Performs maximum intensity projection on single channel z-stacks
* [LIFs2TIFs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/LIFs2TIFs.ijm): Exports all series of each LIF as TIFs
* batch_32bitRGB_to_8bitX: Extracts R, G or B from RGB TIFs to reduce filesize by 75%, as [Fiji macro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_32bitRGB_to_8bitX.ijm) or as [Bash shell script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_32bitRGB_to_8bitX.sh).
* [batch_tile_2D_images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_tile_2D_images.ijm): Splits 2D single-channel images into a specified number of tiles.
