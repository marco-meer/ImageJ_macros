# ImageJ_macros
## For batch processing of z-stack microscopy images

* [batch_splitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_splitter.ijm): Splits multi-channel z-stacks into single-channel z-stacks
* [batch_rescaler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_rescaler.ijm): Rescales single-channel z-stacks
* [batch_MIP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_MIP.ijm): Performs maximum intensity projection on single channel z-stacks
* [LIFs2TIFs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/LIFs2TIFs.ijm): takes all LIF files in a folder and exports all series of each LIF as TIFs
* [batch_RGB_to_X_bit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-meer/ImageJ_macros/main/batch_RGB_to_X_bit.ijm): Converts single channel slidecanner RGB into grayscale image to reduce filesize
